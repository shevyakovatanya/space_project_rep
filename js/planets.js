      description: `Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest one in the Solar System.
      It’s rocky and full of craters, just like the Moon.
      Because it’s so close to the Sun, days on Mercury are super hot, but nights are freezing cold!
      A day on Mercury lasts almost 59 Earth days, and it doesn’t have any moons.
      It’s named after the Roman messenger god because it moves so quickly around the Sun.
      If you were on Mercury, you could jump really high because of its low gravity!`,

      description: `Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is almost the same size as Earth,
      which is why it’s sometimes called Earth’s “sister planet.”
      But Venus is way hotter — it’s the hottest planet in the Solar System!
      Its thick clouds trap heat, making the surface hot enough to melt metal.
      A day on Venus is longer than a year, and it spins in the opposite direction from most planets.
      Venus is so bright that you can often see it from Earth just after sunset.`,

      description: `Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only one known to have life!
      It has water, air, and just the right temperature for living things to survive.
      About 70% of Earth’s surface is covered with oceans.
      It has one moon and takes 365 days to go around the Sun.
      Earth spins once every 24 hours, which gives us day and night.
      Earth’s atmosphere protects us from the Sun’s harmful rays and keeps us warm.`,

      description: `Mars is called the “Red Planet” because of its rusty color.
      It’s the fourth planet from the Sun and has the biggest volcano and canyon in the Solar System!
      Scientists think it might have had water — and maybe life — long ago.
      Mars has two tiny moons named Phobos and Deimos.
      It has weak gravity, so you’d weigh less there, and dust storms can last for weeks.
      Rovers explore its surface every day!`,

      description: `Jupiter is the biggest planet in our Solar System — it’s so huge that over 1,300 Earths could fit inside it!
      It’s a gas giant made mostly of hydrogen and helium and has no solid surface.
      Jupiter’s most famous feature is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that’s been raging for hundreds of years!
      It spins super fast, with one day lasting only about 10 hours.
      Jupiter has at least 95 moons, and one of them, Ganymede, is the biggest moon in the Solar System.
      Its gravity is more than twice as strong as Earth’s.`,

      The rings are made of ice, dust, and small rocks.
      Saturn is another gas giant, and it’s so light that it could float in water — if you had a giant bathtub big enough!
      Saturn has more than 80 moons, and one of them, Titan, is even bigger than Mercury.
      It takes about 29 years for Saturn to go around the Sun, and its winds can blow faster than 1,000 km/h!`,

      It’s very cold and windy there, and it’s known as an “ice giant.”
      Uranus is special because it spins on its side, making its seasons super long — each one lasts about 21 years!
      It has 27 moons and faint rings.
      A day on Uranus lasts about 17 hours, and it was the first planet discovered with a telescope.`,

      It’s another “ice giant” and looks blue because of methane gas in its atmosphere.
      Neptune has 14 moons and takes about 165 Earth years to orbit the Sun.
      It has a dark spot, which is a massive storm similar to Jupiter’s red one.
      The winds on Neptune can reach over 2,000 km/h — faster than any hurricane on Earth!`,

        It’s made mostly of hydrogen and helium and is so big that more than one million Earths could fit inside it!
        The Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and its surface is around 5,500°C hot — that’s super hot!
        It takes sunlight only 8 minutes to reach Earth.
        The Sun keeps all the planets in orbit with its strong gravity, and without it, everything would be dark and freezing cold!`,
